## Abstract

With the remarkable array of digital tools available, it can be difficult to determine which ones you’ll really need, particularly when you're in the research stage. Perhaps you only vaguely understand what "digital humanities" is. This workshop will give an overview of digital humanities methods and will address how you find the tools for you. We’ll discuss the genres and tools of DH from text analysis to geospatial mapping and review some of the many online resource directories and resources at The Graduate Center. Feel free to come with your project ideas and questions.

## Learning Objectives

- First, we will introduce the field of “DH”
- Then, we will review various digital methods and tools, for different areas of research, with the goal of stimulating some of your ideas about the kind of work that you want to do and the kinds of tools that you might use. 
- Finally, we will consider five different general methods for using DH. For each one, I will contextualize the method, and point to resources/further readings, show you some specific tools you can use, and some sample projects that implement the method.
